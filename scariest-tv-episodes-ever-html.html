When people think about <a href=#>TV horror</a>, they probably think of the zombies of The Walking Dead or an old episode of an anthology series like The Twilight Zone or Tales From the Crypt that haunted their dreams — or, more recently, Netflix’s very scary Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities.<strong> </strong>The truth is that horror has been a reliable part of the TV landscape for generations, and it’s a remarkably diverse genre.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck2f4eo27001f3g67sif2q3mb@published data-word-count=73>Trimming this list down to fifty was difficult: There are truly terrifying episodes of Dexter, The Outer Limits, Fringe, and others that just barely missed the cut, and you could put together an entire separate list from the very best of Rod Serling’s groundbreaking masterpiece.

The Oscar winner helms the tale of a horror writer, played by Sam Waterston, who starts to see a disfigured man in every reflection. And the man is coming to kill him. It’s bad enough when it’s just in a mirror, but it’s eventually in glasses and even eyes. Some of the production values are dated, but Scorsese delivers enough great shots to justify a revisit.</p>Buy at Amazon <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Amazon</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnw618l7000g3b7oucc2cnz8@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>American Horror Stories, “Ba’al”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw618hf000f3b7oqv80fdv4@published data-word-count=149>Installments of American Horror Stories, the anthology spin-off of Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk’s hit series, often hinge on urban legends or twists that don’t feel particularly satisfying, but this season one offering connects largely due to a committed performance from AHS mainstay Billie Lourd. The star of Booksmart plays Liv, a woman who has been struggling to get pregnant for years with her husband Matt. Right from the beginning, Lourd sells Liv’s emotional journey, so we believe she’ll jump when a receptionist at a fertility clinic offers a statue of a demon that can help make her pregnant. Of course, it’s not long after the baby is born that Liv starts seeing terrifying things on the baby monitor. Like most Stories, it has a twist too many, but Lourd even sells that aspect, highlighting how this woman has been gaslit and manipulated in a way that’s truly terrifying.</p>Stream at Hulu <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xam7to00033k5ycu8i44p5@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>American Horror Story, “Halloween”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xamnv7000r3k5yz2u2pjkg@published data-word-count=99>This list wouldn’t be complete without a chapter of Ryan Murphy’s pop-culture phenomenon, right?

Directed by John Crowley (Brooklyn), “Beyond the Sea” is the tale of two astronauts — Josh Hartnett and Aaron Paul — who can visit home despite being far off in space thanks to a sort of avatar or replica. When cultists butcher one of their families back on Earth, the emotional chasm between the two careens toward a deadly conclusion.

In one of the best performances of Sissy Spacek’s career (and shame on all the awards-giving bodies who snubbed it), the Oscar winner plays a woman teetering on the edge of sanity, unsure not just of what is happening but when. It’s a perfectly constructed examination of dementia, a state in which our memories and our present day can intertwine and get jumbled to such a degree that tragedy can ensue.

No-End House initially appears to be a standard haunted-house tale — the new mansion on the end of the block that promises six rooms of spine-shattering fear — but episodes like “This Isn’t Real” owe more to David Lynch and David Cronenberg than anything else. Plus, co-star John Carroll Lynch does fantastic supporting work.

As with most episodes of Doctor Who, there’s time travel and witty banter, but what’s unforgettable about “Blink” are those aliens masquerading as angelic religious statues, figures with their hands over their eyes and murder in their hearts. They move if you’re not looking at them. They’ll kill you in the time it takes to blink.

More than any Flanagan project, The Fall of the House of Usher is an unforgivingly brutal sequence of comeuppances for its characters, using some of the new master of horror’s greatest tricks to dispatch them. Flanagan and his team cleverly twist Poe’s short stories to fit their narrative of the literal destruction of a powerful family, and the most unforgettably vicious chapter comes just past the halfway point of the season in their riff on “The Tell-Tale Heart.” By this point in the show, there have been multiple brutal deaths, but the reveal of what Victorine did to Al is one of the most WTF moments in the history of television, followed by the undeniable horror of what she then does in front of her father. There may be moodier episodes of this show that one could argue should be here instead, but this is a representative of the overall fearlessness of The Fall of the House of Usher to provide images you can’t forget.</p>Stream on Netflix <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Netflix</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9n83uwk00uq3b72ghhi3oct@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Fear Itself, “Eater”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9n84bd400ve3b72k72yphrp@published data-word-count=169>In summer 2008, NBC launched its own version of Masters of Horror with the short-lived Fear Itself, created by Mick Garris. It was a massive bomb, pulled from the network before its final five episodes were even allowed to air, but it did have a few standout chapters, including “Skin & Bones” by Larry Fessenden and “The Sacrifice” with a young Jesse Plemons. The best episode was the fifth, “Eater,” directed by the legendary Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator) and starring Elisabeth Moss, Russell Hornsby, and Pablo Schreiber. Moss plays a young cop at a station that happens to be housing a vicious serial killer who has been known to eat his victims, slowly and painfully. As the night goes on, the Mad Men star becomes convinced that there’s more to the Eater than mere cannibalism, coming to believe that her fellow male cops are being impacted by the killing machine.

The great Mark Ivanir plays a man who has been compassionately harvesting organs all around town, leaving his victims more alive than they should be after he takes their body parts. As if that’s not creepy enough, it’s revealed that he’s been taking the organs to put in the body of a ballerina who committed suicide and bring her back to life. The image of his own Frankenstein’s monster installed in what’s basically a marionette system by her creator is one of the show’s most memorable in its entire run.</p>Stream on Max and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Max</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl9n8f0zq00zw3b72d2yxyocs@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities, “The Murmuring”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl9n8frrq010j3b72ci0z918s@published data-word-count=167>The brilliant Guillermo del Toro has produced an anthology series for Netflix that echoes projects like Masters of Horror, presenting eight different episodes by eight excellent horror directors, including Panos Cosmatos (Mandy), David Prior (The Empty Man) and Ana Lily Amirpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night).

The phenomenally talented Davis plays a grieving bird expert, filming flocks of birds on a nature project with her husband (an excellent Andrew Lincoln) and living in a creepy old house while she does. As something in the house starts to try to get her attention, “The Murmuring” becomes a perfect distillation of Kent’s interests and those of del Toro, who wrote the story on which this chapter is based.

Take the fifth chapter of the first season, an episode that seems to be almost heartwarming in the way it figures out how to bring David and Syd (Rachel Keller) together before spiraling into something else entirely. After David rescues his sister Amy (Katie Aselton), reality fractures in a few places that allow both Aubrey Plaza’s riveting Lenny and the monstrous Devil with Yellow Eyes to reveal the depth of David’s pain.

The penultimate chapter of The Last of Us centers Ellie and her discovery of a vile preacher named David, a cultist who has turned his people into monsters by feeding them human flesh. The show really reaches its thematic climax here with the clarity that it’s the survivors who are deadlier than the monsters in this post-apocalyptic world, ending in a truly unforgettable sequence in which David tries to rape Ellie and she’s forced to kill him to survive.

Her husband (Hamish Linklater) is accused of and then confesses to a lifetime of horrific crimes involving his patients as a pediatrician, leaving Beharie’s character haunted by the decisions she’s made over her life, and maybe even the times she looked the other way, including possibly with her own son.

His boredom leads him to a beautiful woman and her older husband, deciding that he will do whatever it takes to have her. When another Brit suggests a regional murder technique in which an earwig is put in the victim’s ear and eats its way to its brain, Hervey agrees, only to wake up and find out that he’s become the host of the bug of death by accident.

Most of the show hinged more on science-fiction ideas than horror, but this 1963 episode is a nice blend of the two. It basically turns something as intellectual as a California physics research center into a haunted house. The opening scene is a beauty, as a cleaning lady tries to suck up a dust bunny and appears to be scared to death by what comes bursting out of the vacuum cleaner. The reveal — that a mad scientist is using a malevolent force to kill people and then bring them back to life — is something straight out of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.

When his son reaches the right age, he takes him to the same playground, but his demons come with him.

Not as brain-eating zombies but exactly as they were when they left your life. The mystery of why these people have returned is the central focus of season one, but there’s also the unsettling question of what they want now that they have come back.

When Leland Palmer, flipping back and forth between his real self and that of the demonic Killer Bob, kills Madeline, it was like nothing ever seen on television.</p>Stream on Paramount+ <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Paramount+</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xamjfb000n3k5y3rzs1c2k@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Walking Dead, “Days Gone Bye”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xankjo001k3k5y1tgmdnw7@published data-word-count=120>This AMC hit has so many deaths and horrific moments, they can often blend together after all these years. Although season three’s “Seed” might be more straight-up terrifying, “Days Gone Bye” is where the Walking Dead phenomenon began. Directed by Frank Darabont, this episode felt like a breakthrough when it aired in 2010. It was more like a short film than what we expected from basic cable TV —&nbsp;partially because it was shot on 16mm — and it revealed how far The Walking Dead would go in terms of gore and violence usually reserved for R-rated films. “Days Gone Bye” played a big role in tilting prestige TV toward horror, and it’s still one of the best episodes you’ll find.</p>Stream on Netflix <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Netflix</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cj8xb99yz00043k5yy2qh2ue9@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The X-Files, “Home”</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8xb96r000023k5yotbspkof@published data-word-count=86>An episode of television so disturbing that Fox seems almost apologetic that they ever aired it. For years, “Home” wasn’t included in syndicated rotation of The X-Files because it was deemed too much for audiences to experience again. In this stand-alone episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a family of deformed people who haven’t left their home in years —&nbsp;and they find dark secrets hiding under the floorboards. Incredibly violent and grotesque even by today’s standards, “Home” has lost none of its brutal power two decades later.</p>Stream on Hulu and Freevee <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Hulu</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Freevee</a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl8vrngv40000opfgxs6ep4hw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>A Spooky Guide to the Best New Horror to Stream This October</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-923e58d43e0abe4896f53d4d9e37f787@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>25 Great Halloween Sitcom Episodes to Stream During Spooky Season</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl9h8ksc80000f8iq42vutyji@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>21 Horror Games to Play This Spooky Season</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The 50 Scariest TV Episodes to Watch This Halloween</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny0r8CroJ6rpGLBt3nEqaCsp5SawG6x1Z6pZ6Ckork%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fscariest-tv-episodes-ever-html.html&title=The%2050%20Most%20Terrifying%20TV%20Episodes%20to%20Watch%20This%20Halloween" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscariest-tv-episodes-ever-html.html&description=The%2050%20Most%20Terrifying%20TV%20Episodes%20to%20Watch%20This%20Halloween" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscariest-tv-episodes-ever-html.html&title=The%2050%20Most%20Terrifying%20TV%20Episodes%20to%20Watch%20This%20Halloween" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fscariest-tv-episodes-ever-html.html&title=The%2050%20Most%20Terrifying%20TV%20Episodes%20to%20Watch%20This%20Halloween" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fscariest-tv-episodes-ever-html.html&text=The%2050%20Most%20Terrifying%20TV%20Episodes%20to%20Watch%20This%20Halloween" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fscariest-tv-episodes-ever-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Larita Shotwell</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-05-17</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./types-of-leaf-venation.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Types of leaf venation</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./taye-diggs-idina-menzels-son-isnt-pursuing-acting-refreshing.html><h3>Taye Diggs, Idina Menzels Son Isn't Pursuing Acting: Refreshing >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
